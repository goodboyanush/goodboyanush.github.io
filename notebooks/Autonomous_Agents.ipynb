      "\n",
      "#### Plan Review\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Research Phase**: \n",
      "   - The plan to conduct a comprehensive literature review using academic databases is sound. However, it would be beneficial to include specific search terms and criteria to ensure the search is thorough and relevant.\n",
      "   - Including verifiable information such as source URLs for each paper would enhance the credibility and allow for easy access to the original research.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Collection**:\n",
      "   - The details to be collected are appropriate and comprehensive. However, adding a column for the source URL would be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Data Organization**:\n",
      "   - Organizing the data into a structured format is essential. Using a spreadsheet or database would facilitate easier manipulation and conversion to markdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Markdown Table Creation**:\n",
      "   - Writing a script to convert structured data into a markdown table is a good approach. This ensures consistency and reduces manual errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Review and Finalization**:\n",
      "   - The review process is crucial to ensure accuracy and completeness. It would be helpful to have a checklist for the review process.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Delivery**:\n",
      "   - The final delivery should include both the markdown table and the source URLs for verification.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Execution Review\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Research Phase**:\n",
      "   - The literature review appears to have been conducted effectively, with relevant and recent papers identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Collection**:\n",
      "   - The collected data is comprehensive and covers all necessary details. However, the source URLs are missing, which are crucial for verification.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Data Organization**:\n",
      "   - The data is well-organized in the markdown table format.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Markdown Table Creation**:\n",
      "   - The markdown table is well-formatted and easy to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Review and Finalization**:\n",
      "   - The table appears accurate and complete, but the inclusion of source URLs is necessary for verification.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Delivery**:\n",
      "   - The final markdown table is delivered, but it should include source URLs for each paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Include Source URLs**: Add a column for the source URL in the markdown table to provide verifiable information.\n",
      "2. **Script for Automation**: Consider writing a script to automate the conversion of structured data into a markdown table for future tasks.\n",
      "3. **Detailed Review Checklist**: Develop a checklist for the review process to ensure all necessary details are included and accurate.\n",

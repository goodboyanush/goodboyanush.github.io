## DLPaper2Code

Q1: How often do you read a research paper discussing a deep learning algorithm ? 

Q2: How much time does it take for you to understand the research paper? 

Q3: Assuming that you are successful in understanding the paper, how much time does it take for you to implement the paper in a single library?

## Semantic Sentence Similarity Models using DARVIZ

Given two sentences, how semantically similar are the two sentences? This is a common task in natural language processing. Deep learning has produced some state-of-the-art results in the task of semantic sentence similarity.

## Natural Language Regression using DARVIZ

While working with natural langauge processing, we often come across the task of predicting a continuous valued integer output for a given input sentence. This includes tasks such as (i) sentiment prediction for a statement, (ii) impact prediction of a title, (iii) grammatical correctness of a sentence, (iv) importance of a tweet, and many more. This is commonly called as natural language regression.

## ML4Creativity - Workshop @ KDD-2017, Halifax, Canada

The first workshop on Machine Learning for Creativity (ML4Creativity) was co-hosted with KDD-2017, held at Halifax, Nova Scotia. I was one of the co-organizers of this exciting workshop along with my colleageus from IBM Research, Sony CSL, Google Brain, and UIUC.

In this blog post, I share my summary of this workshop, along with some interesting observations, and key take-ways.

# DLPaper2Code

Q1: How often do you read a research paper discussing a deep learning algorithm ? 

Q2: Assuming that you come across a relevant research paper, how much time does it take for you to understand the research paper? 

Q3: Assuming that you are successful in understanding the paper, how much time does it take for you to implement the paper in a single library (say Tensorflow) ?

Q4: Assuming that you implement the research paper in a single library, how much time does it take for you to implement the research paper in other libraries (say Keras, Caffe, PyTorch etc) ?

Q5: Assuming that you implemented the research paper in multiple libraries, how much time does it take for you to debug the implementation and make it bug free?

**Answer: Assuming that you have read this post till here, what if I say that the time taken for you to read the above 5 questions is now more than the time taken for you to perform them!**

This is our goal in our research paper published in the  AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18) called "[DLPaper2Code: Auto-generation of Code from Deep Learning Research Papers](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/02/deep-learning-models/)"

## IBM Deep Learning IDE (DL-IDE)

Along with this, we have built our easy-to-use, intuitive IDE for deep learning called -[IBM Deep Learning IDE (DL-IDE)](https://dlide.mybluemix.net/). Play around with it - lots of cool features secretly built into it and lot more coming!

## AAAI 2018 Presence

I am presenting four of our research papers in #AAAI2018, New Orleans ([AAAI](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-18/))
